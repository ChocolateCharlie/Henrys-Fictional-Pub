# Henry's Fictional Pub

This is my *Henry's Fictional Pub* app, issued from the following Udacity's course : ***Android Basics : User Interface***

Project 1 : Build a Single Screen App

### Code review

I did my best to follow the project specification, but my code has not been reviewed.

The project was tested on my phone and on the Nexus 5X emulator.
